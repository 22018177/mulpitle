# Love Death And Etetrnity
members:Jiaxin Liang(It's me)/Yuwei Fei/Yan Zhang



Introductionï¼šInitiated by the heartbeat (love) of the person who touches it, forever away from the dead electronic plant.

# week 4
We discussed many forms of expression before deciding on the plan, and finally chose something that the three of us empathized with, that is, the experience of all three of us raising dead plants. We intend to use this as a center to make a plant that will not die.

We searched the internet for examples of Arduino and plant combinations.we imagined all kinds of possibilities for its future, such as having heartbeat, play with me, feeling the environment.

We plan to have input:heart rate sensor; Ultrasonic sensor;MP3 Trigger;
out put:LED;motor;speaker

Plants are born of our love, Plants come from death but are far from dead, and we share our heartbeats with it, and the moment when the lights shine on our faces is short and eternal.
The plant can burst into color with just a touch of the heart rate sensor. light will change with your heart rate. Its petals will open and light up,  dancing. And play some sound.

# week 5
After we determined the general direction (making an exclusive electronic flower pet), we decided to try to make a demo first to determine how it would work. We purchased 3mm and 1mm diameter iron wires, cotton threads, rubber bands, and knives.

We decided to make a flower that can open and close physically. We used an umbrella structure to connect the servo to control the opening and closing of the flower.

We only made two petals to preview the effect. I adjusted the direction of the petals and the umbrella The distance of the shape structure allows it to open and close naturally. After connecting the arduino board, we try to enter the code. At first, the ultrasonic wave does not work, but after changing the data, it moves successfully.

# week 6
After we determined the demo, we made a detailed design of its skeleton.

We finally decided to use copper tubes and copper wires to make the skeleton. We used 1mm, 1.5mm copper wires and 2mm, 2.5mm copper tubes to achieve flowers A movable umbrella structure.

At first, we tried to cut the copper pipe and wire with pliers and scissors, which worked fine for the copper wire, however once we used scissors or pliers to cut the copper pipe, it distorted the hollow circle. Peter helped us think of many ways, and finally we used a saw, fixed the copper pipe on the cutting table, and cut it gently and slowly with the saw (once the force is too strong, the hollow shape in the middle will be deformed) Then sand over any overly sharp cuts.

After we bent the copper wire into the shape we wanted and strung the copper tubes in place, we started the soldering work. We encountered great difficulties.

It is very difficult to solder the copper wires with tin and it is very slippery. We tried sanding the copper wire before welding, which worked, but it was not very useful. We could only weld over and over again. Often just after welding, it separated in a blink of an eye and had to be re-soldered.

# Week 7

We decided to use China Organza to make the petals of the flowers, because what we want is a translucent and flowing effect.

We searched the information and found that organza is not easy to color and fix the shape. It needs to be washed first to make the organza As our hearts change. We use white latex to wash the organza, soak the organza with white latex mixed with water, let the organza completely soak in the white latex, use a hair dryer to blow it until it is half dry, let it dry naturally.

Fei Yuwei saw it I dyed the fabric we had processed, and Zhang Yan ironed out the shape of the petals. Finally, Zhang Yan and I installed the petals on the skeleton of the flower (during the period, the welded part became loose again, and we had to Constantly going to school to repeat soldering.)

# Week 8

I got the Sparkfun mp3 tigger from Peter, and after going through the tutorials on modle, I tried tweaking our music code. I connected the Sparkfun mp3 tigger step by step according to the instructions on the link, entered the code, and saved the music. But when I started it for the first time, the music played had a huge current sound. I tried to replace it with a pure human voice test audio, which worked well, but when I replaced it with the pure human voice audio required by our project, it was produced again. Loud electrical noise, maybe I should try to solve it elsewhere.

By the way, the skeleton of the flower is really loose, so we can only continue to weld. (My hand hurt TAT)

# Week 9
I made the circuit diagram and soldered the circuit board with Zhang Yan. I didn't modify any code about the mp3, but the sound it made seems to be normal, without the sound of excessive current. I think maybe it was due to poor wiring before. So the mp3 can't sound normally.

We installed the flowers together.

I put all the wires where they should be, adjusted the position of the parts, and thought of many ways to make the flowers open and close smoothly. I was going to use a glue gun to weld the servos to the acrylic board, but we are not sure where. The final effect is fixed with tape, which is slightly loose, but I'm afraid that if the tape is removed and the servo is fixed with a glue gun, the position of the servo will change. So I decided that as long as she can achieve results, I will not change anything.

After debugging, we shot a video together and made a PPT. All things done.
